## How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
By requesting input from users, we can get an insight as to what users want. We then take that input and create user stories
for developers to work on and implement. 

## How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I look forward to implementing agile in my future teams. I will attend all scrum sessions to ensure an efficient and cohesive team.

## What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Be willing to take on different aspects of the application being built. Allow for team to be able to freely express both accomplishments
and concerns. Ensure that team members are not constantly overloaded.
